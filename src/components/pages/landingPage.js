        <p className="Me-Paragraph">
          Hi! My name is Logan. I am currently an IT professional with a passion
          for web development based in Kansas. Over the past four years, I've
          immersed myself in the dynamic world of information technology, honing
          my skills in various roles. For 3 years, I worked as an Incident
          Technology Support Specialist for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in my
          home town. Being that that was a seasonal position, I spent the off
          season pursuing other IT roles while simultaniously supporting the BIA
          with tasks such as prescribed burns.

          In the past year, I've been dedicated to a full-time help desk
          position while simultaniously pursuing my education at BloomTech, from
          which I recently graduated. My journey has equipped me with a robust
          set of skills and knowledge in web development, making me eager to
          contribute to innovative projects. As I look ahead, I'm hopeful and
          excited about the prospect of expanding my experiences with a new role
          in the near future. I invite you to explore my site and discover more
          about my professional journey. Enjoy your visit!
